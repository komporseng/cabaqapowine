Ortiz’s Net Worth?</span></h2><p>Luis D. Ortiz, a Puerto Rican-born American, is a successful real estate agent and reality TV personality with a net worth of $16 million. He gained fame from his role in Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing New York,” which he joined in 2013 during its second season.</p><p>In 2016, Luis left the show and real estate business, moving to Paris for a while before returning to the series in 2019. He was previously Vice President of Keller Williams in New York City, but was let go due to the company’s disinterest in being associated with reality TV.</p><p>Later, Luis joined the Douglas Elliman firm and eventually established his own real estate firm, Ortiz & Co.</p><h2><span id=Luis_D_Ortizs_Early_Life_and_Career>Luis D. Ortiz’s Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Luis D. Ortiz was born on November 13, 1986, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. At age 16, he and his twin brother left Puerto Rico for Florida, where Ortiz worked at a Hollister store and as a college janitor. He later moved to New York to attend the New York Film Academy, where he made his first short film, “Amalia,” at age 19. The film won the award for Best Direction at the 2007 Puerto Rico Film Festival. Ortiz then raised money to shoot “The Theatre of the Absurd” in New York in 2008, but he was not satisfied with the final product and never released it.</p><h2><span id=Luis_D_Ortiz_From_Filmmaking_to_Real_Estate>Luis D. Ortiz: From Filmmaking to Real Estate</span></h2><p>After being disappointed with “The Theatre of the Absurd,” Luis D. Ortiz decided that filmmaking was not for him. He rented a New York apartment and was offered a job by his broker, David Yomtobian, at Blackstone Properties. Ortiz started selling rentals at Blackstone before moving to Prodigy Network and then Synergy. His first sale was a $5.9 million home in Battery Park, which he sold to a Goldman Sachs partner that he had previously rented an apartment to.</p><p>Within his first year as an agent, Ortiz was renting 25 to 30 apartments a month and was becoming highly sought after by building owners and management companies. He moved from rental contracts to sales in 2009 and had cleared $20 million within months. By 2010, major boutique rentals and sales firms were calling, and he began working for the high-end Synergy NYC, where he grossed $75 million annually.</p><p>“Million Dollar Listing New York” started airing in March 2012, but Ortiz had never watched the show. He was eventually cast on the show, despite concerns from the executive producers about him moving from Synergy to Keller Williams NYC. Season two of the show began airing in May 2013, following Luis, Ryan Serhant, and Fredrik Eklund as they tried to close exclusive deals across New York.</p><p>Keller Williams fired Ortiz in August 2013, shortly after the season finale aired. Within days, he was hired by Douglas Elliman, the largest residential real estate firm in New York. On the season five finale of “Million Dollar Listing New York,” Luis announced that he was leaving the real estate business because it no longer made him happy. He moved to Paris in March 2017 but returned to New York in June 2018 after struggling with depression and having suicidal thoughts. He rejoined Douglas Elliman and the cast of “Million Dollar Listing New York” for the show’s eighth season.</p><h2><span id=Luis_D_Ortiz_Personal_Life_and_Controversies>Luis D. Ortiz: Personal Life and Controversies</span></h2><p>Luis D. Ortiz welcomed a daughter, Leela, with his ex-girlfriend in March 2019. He was previously ranked #19 on “Us Weekly’s” list of the most stylish New Yorkers in 2013. However, during the second season of “Million Dollar Listing New York,” Ortiz faced controversy when he sent out an email blast featuring photoshopped pictures of the interior of a property at 27 Downing Street, stating “If I put the real photos out there, not a single person will ever come inside.” The New York State Department of State investigated the listing, and Ortiz later apologized, stating that he “learned what not to do in the future and that lesson is worth having done what [he] did.”</p><h2><span id=Luis_D_Ortizs_Apartment_in_Abington_House>Luis D. Ortiz’s Apartment in Abington House</span></h2><p>In 2014, Luis D. Ortiz moved into an apartment in Abington House located in the Chelsea area of New York City. The apartment was described by Luis as “a grownup’s apartment” and was rented for $7,000 per month. Prior to this, he lived in Battery Park City where he enjoyed stunning views of the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC41KKqZpxdpL%2B1tdlmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
