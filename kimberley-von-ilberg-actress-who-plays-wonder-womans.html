Kimberley von Ilberg, who filled in for Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in the show’s conclusion, revealed her name, putting many uncertainties to rest. She just released a behind-the-scenes image of herself donning the renowned Princess of Themyscira’s armor. She and the other Superman and Batman stand-ins announced their presence in the finale through Instagram postings.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kimberley-von-Ilberg-3.jpg alt="Kimberley von Ilberg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Who played Wonder Woman’s body double in the season one finale of Peacemaker?</h2><p>Kimberley von Ilberg posted an Instagram snapshot of herself costumed as Wonder Woman from the DC Extended Universe, as well as a photo of the Wonder Woman-themed entry to her trailer.&nbsp;Von Ilberg had a minor part in the 2017 short film Consume before playing Wonder Woman in Peacemaker.&nbsp;She was also a part of the stunt team for the 2012 film Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kimberley-von-Ilberg-1.jpg alt="Kimberley von Ilberg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>&nbsp;In the season finale, all of the other bodies duplicate the Justice League heroes.</h2><p>Brad Abramenko, in addition to Kimberley, played Man of Steel. He has appeared in cameos on other DC series such as Batwoman and The Flash. Even though Matt Turner was hired as Ben Affleck’s Batman body double, the Dark Knight and Cyborg (played by Ray Fisher) were cut from the show’s conclusion. In terms of Batman, this indicates that Robert Pattinson will be a separate character outside the DCEU, with his first film set to be released in two weeks. Ben Affleck’s depiction of the character would have been a long shot as well, considering that The Flash marks his last appearance in the role. Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins are also slated to collaborate on a third standalone Wonder Woman film.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqWSmr%2BtsdhmraimXZ65o7HRoGSam6SnsrS%2FjLCfqGWgoa66v4ywpqeclad6uLvMmqWsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
