According to Marilynn Johnson's <a href=#>history</a> of police violence, cases of police brutality were common in late 19th century New York City, when Austen took her photos. These cases often came when police encountered drunk or rowdy pedestrians, or for as a little as challenging an officer's authority. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Post Man" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/post-man.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A postman stops to collect mail. In the 1800s, the <a href=#>postal service</a> saw an incredible expansion. The service used railroads to carry mail, decreasing delivery times, and by 1893 postmen began free mail delivery service in cities. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Pretzel Cart" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pretzel-cart.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Pretzel carts are ubiquitous in present-day New York City, and this snack was an equally common sight in the late 19th century. European immigrants often made their living selling food on the street, usually influenced by their own cuisine, like sausages, pickles, hot corn, even oysters, until more affordable restaurants put most of them out of business. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Street Vendor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/street-vendor.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A popular street vendor draws a crowd. In 1886, New York's City's Lower East Side got its first <a href=#>pushcart market</a>, where mostly Jewish peddlers sold food and other goods on the sidewalks, resembling the now-popular farmer's markets popular in the city. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Rag Cart" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rag-cart.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Rag-pickers, also known as a Chiffonnier, salvaged garbage like glass and scraps of clothing, that would then be sold by weight to be recycled. Rag picking was considered an honest occupation, a step above beggars. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt=Sponges style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sponges.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Another vendor shows off his collection of for-sale sponges. Police tried to control street peddlers, but only loosely enforced regulations like the "30-minute-law," which required street vendors to constantly relocate. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Shoe Strings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shoe-strings.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A vendor sells shoe strings on the sidewalk. This era saw an immigration boom combined with an economic depression that resulted in an increase in the city's poor, out of work population. By 1897, New York City established 18 <a href=#>"settlement houses"</a> to help immigrants adapt to life in America. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Street Sweeper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/street-sweeper.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A street sweeper clears the sidewalk. During this period, no organized efforts existed to keep the city <a href=#>clean</a>, except for these men armed with just a broom. Horses like those pulling hansom cabs left the city buried under manure. </span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span> <img alt="Taxi Cab Driver" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/taxi-cab-driver.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A vigilant taxi cab driver inspects his vehicle. Around the time Austen took her photos, only 12 <a href=#>electric</a> cabs operated in New York City.</span><span class=credit>NYPL/Alice Austen</span><p class=dropcaps>Alice Austen was never a professional photographer. She was simply the daughter of a prominent Staten Island family, and who once received a camera from her uncle as a gift.</p><p>Although untrained, Austen soon proved her skill behind the camera. Indeed, her photos of New York City streets circa 1896 provide a rare, vivid record of what life was like for the New Yorkers who made their living on the sidewalks.</p><p>Postmen, messengers, police officers, street vendors -- Austen saw the lives of these ordinary New Yorkers as inspiration for her work. Above, you'll find 15 of her most stunning shots, all of which evoke both the lives of those ordinary people as well as the time and place from which they came.</p><p>Next, find out what Brooklyn looked like <a href=#>before the hipster invasion</a>.
