The star recently posted a series of bikini photos on <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/thejeanniemai/>Instagram</a>, and fans were left stunned with her figure.</p><p class=Zg>In the pics, Mai is wearing a two-piece royal blue bikini, a vizor, and a golden necklace as she makes her way out of the beach.

The star did so by posting a side to side picture wearing a metallic bronze dress before and after she started to work out and eat more. She wrote:</p><p class=Zg>“On the left is the first time I tried on this dress, at a weight I’ve kept for 12 years, 103 lbs. Staying 103 came from my self-control to lose ‘chubby’ teenage weight and a stressful idea that my body was built to look best ‘thin.’ As I’m nearing my 40s, I realize that I’ve been thru so much s— mentally and emotionally, why the hell should my body be forced to suffer (from my over controlling ways) too?”</p><p class=Zg>Mai revealed that she had gained 17lbs after starting a new eating plan and training program, and admitted that while she doesn’t have a precise weight goal, she just wants to be physically and mentally stronger.</p><p class=Zg>Talking to Shape, Mai offered a piece of advice for women who are struggling to love themselves because of the numbers on a scale, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.shape.com/celebrities/interviews/how-lifting-heavy-weights-gaining-weight-helped-jeannie-mai-love-her-body>saying</a>:</p><p class=Zg>“Feeling good about your body and feeling sexy comes from within, not from a number on the scale. Your body is just an extension of who you are. Treat it well, be kind to it, and just enjoy life. That's where true satisfaction lies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpna3BoZXqrscCnpaKdXaKuqnnSoaawq12owbC5wJyfZqyRqcGwu4yfrKWklad7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
