I still like the dubs of OS & AG before TPCi took over despite the flaws, though it's still obviously superior in Japanese even then that said, but from late AG onward I actively seek out the Japanese Version whenever I can find it (the sagas I most badly wanted to watch subbed for a long time are BF & DP, and they are finally fansubbed, so no complaints anymore there)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The censorship/editing was nonsensical though in the OG run, but that didn't bother me nearly as much as most people, and it's been garbage again in the modern dub from SM onwards into JN too in the TPCi run as well that said.</p><p>Team Rocket was also far easier to understand in the English run, before JCC decided to have them talk in rhymes, alliteration, and gave Meowth "Dig it" and "Lugs" for the rest of the Series somewhere in the middle of DP for some reason. While the script writing was still flawed and had its cringy moments, it was still a little better, than what we get today in terms of having people speak like normal human beings most of the time.</p><p>Generations, subbed, the dub has awful VA work despite LA based VAs- awful stuff, phoned in and lifeless.</p><p>Origins, the dub is better than Generations and the main Anime dub these days, but Red is still an awkward choice in hindsight and it starts to downturn in File 4 for some reason- but it's watchable in English, doesn't make me cringe like Generations does.</p><p>Yu-Gi-Oh?</p><p>Subbed in general, while I have nostalgia for the original dub of Duel Monsters it's generally garbage after Duelist Kingdom and the ending of the Memory World Arc- Battle City is an ENTIRELY different experience in Japanese, to name the nadir of it in English. The VA work holds up, but everything else is trash, unlike w/Pokemon's early dubbing.</p><p>One Piece?</p><p>The FUNimation dub is about on par with the Japanese Version, no preference there, but the 4Kids dub is an abomination and unwatchable outside of Abridged Parody style mocking (a shame they blew it so hard with One Piece, that YouTube will pretend everything 4Kids did was even close to that bad because of this dub, minus the still bad censorship practices elsewhere and scripts save Pokemon and TMNT 2003) and the Odex dub has even worse VA work than the 4Kids dub even if Uncut.</p><p>Dragonball/Z/GT/Kai?</p><p>Dragonball is fine in English either under FUNimation or Blue Water, but Blue Water has garbage VA work compared to FUNimation save Zoe Slusar who is inferior to Stephanie Nadolny IMO but not unlistenable either FWIW. The script is decent, even if it takes liberties, no censorship/editing off of CN, the OST is kept, and the VA work is much better than it is in Dragonball Z.</p><p>Dragonball Z is FAR better in Japanese, people don't get the nuance of Masako Nozawa's Son Goku and find it awkward to hearing him sound like a child- but THAT is Goku, not the Superman FUNimation version many of us grew up with from 1999-2003. The script is stupid in the dub, too, I'm talking worse than early 4Kids/Saban/DiC tier when they first took over from the Ocean Group and even in the Saban dub it can be stupid too- the VA work is mediocre, but at its worst in Season 3 for obvious reasons. The only way Dragonball Z is watchable in English w/o heavy nostalgia goggle filter save perhaps the Ocean Group's VA work early on in the cut/censored edited dub of the first 53 episodes (Faulconer's score is TRASH, it has not aged well at ALL, and as it is he was trying to mimic Levy/Mahehi's score from the edited/censored Saban dub for FUNimation it turns out when he took over in EP054) is ironically the maligned Orange Brick releases with the Kikuchi score intact from 2007 onwards as they went back and redubbed their amateurish, pathetic work in 1999 save Schemmel's Goku which is still dismal in Seasons 3-4 before he gets a hold of his own take from late Season 4 onwards.</p><p>Dragonball Z Kai is GREAT in English, I could go either way between this and the Japanese Version, FUNi did a much better job here (though I concede Stephanie Nadolny's Kid Goku was missed from Dragonball very much, Colleen Clinkenbeard eventually settled into her own Kid Gohan but never got the former right to this day to me) and proof of this lies in Chris Ayres' Frieza which is 1000x better than Linda Young's poor imitation of Pauline Newstone's in the Z dub to me and a much improved script adaptation.</p><p>Dragonball GT is okay in English, but it is better in Japanese though.</p><p>Death Note?</p><p>Either way, both equally good, I like Brad Swaile as Light Yagami a lot and also Brian Drummond as Ryuk in particular just as much as the seiyus.</p><p>Etc. etc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHylu4yypq5loKeyp7HRZquoZaeWwaS0jJqloqWVYsC2rsGem2anomKxtq7BnptnamlsgXiFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
