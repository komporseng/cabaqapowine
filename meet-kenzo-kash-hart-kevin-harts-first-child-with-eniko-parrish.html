He is a famous comedian and actor with many great acting credits. Some of the hit movies he has featured in include “Think Like A Man Too,” “Central Intelligence,” and “Ride Along.”&nbsp;</p><p>As a star, Kevin has endured his fair share of scandals. However, Parrish has stuck with him through it all. Parrish is a model and social media influencer with a large fan base on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/parrish.jpg><p>Parrish achieved some measure of fame walking the runway in the 2013 BET TV series “Rip the Runway.” The program was focused on fashion and music and was hosted by famous singer Kelly Rowland.&nbsp;</p><p>After Parrish met and married Kevin, her fame skyrocketed, and she became a household name in Hollywood. Kenzo Kash Hart was the first child the couple welcomed. As such, their fans are often curious to know as much as they can about him.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kenzo_Kash_Hart_Background></span>Kenzo Kash Hart&nbsp;Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kenzo Kash Hart was born on November 21, 2017. His proud father announced the great news via Twitter. He wrote:&nbsp;</p><p>“God is truly amazing … Kenzo Kash Hart was born at 1:45 am. He is healthy & already smiling. Thank you all for your prayers!!!! We love & appreciate ya #Harts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kash.jpg><p>He is the first child the comedian welcomed with Parrish but is not the one who made him a father. Before welcoming him, Kevin was already a father to two other kids from his previous marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Kenzo, who now has a younger sister named Kaori, is loved by his parents and their fans. The cute boy shares an Instagram page with his younger sibling. His mother, Parrish, runs the account and ensures his cheerful personality shines through in her posts.</p><p>The account has a considerable following from netizens who can’t get enough of Kenzo and contains different pictures of Kenzo and Kaori. Some photos capture Kenzo’s heartwarming smiles, while others usually show him playing with the coolest toys or swimming.&nbsp;</p><p>Like most of his kids, Kenzo has a close bond with Kevin. The pair have been<a href=#> pictured </a>on different adventures and always look happy to spend time with one another.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kenzo_Kash_Harts_Nicknames></span>Kenzo Kash Hart’s Nicknames&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2020, Kenzo Kash Hart celebrated his 3rd birthday, and his doting father gave him a shout-out on Instagram while sharing some of his nicknames.</p><p>Kevin wrote: “Happy B-Day to the coolest 3yr old on the planet. Daddy & Mommy love you to death, Zo aka Bear, aka Hot Feet, aka Heavy Head, aka Pitter Pater, aka Prince Zo, aka Little Burger King, because you have to have it your way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kev.jpg><p>Kenzo has also inherited his father’s love for the Philadelphia Eagles. On January 29, 2023, he joined his dad and older siblings, Heaven and Hendrix, at the Eagles game against the San Francisco 49ers.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin shared photos from their seats on his Instagram page. One of the pictures captured a beaming Kenzo sporting a Reggie White jersey. The Eagles won the game and were able to proceed to the Superbowl.&nbsp;</p><p>However, some days later, they were ousted from the competition by the Kansas City Chiefs. The loss saddened Kenzo. Kevin shared a video of himself on FaceTime with a crying Kenzo.&nbsp;</p><p>He told his father: “… I’m still sad a little bit,” to which Kevin responded: “Daddy is sad too, but you know what, Zo? We’re Eagles fans. We’re Eagles fans till we die.”</p><p>The proud dad <a href=#>captioned</a> the footage. “We are hurting in the Hart Household…. I still love my city and my team!!!!! Thank you for an amazing season ….. We will be back next year!!!!!! My little man was crushed.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Did_Kenzos_Parents_Nearly_Split></span>Why Did Kenzo’s Parents Nearly Split?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2017, while Parrish was eight months pregnant with Kenzo, rumors started circulating that Kevin had cheated on her. In the third episode of his Netflix original docuseries, “Kevin Hart: Don’t F**k This Up,” Kevin and Parrish shared deep insights into what happened.&nbsp;</p><p>The episode started with Parrish revealing how she found out that her hubby had cheated on her – via a direct message. It hurt Parrish, but she kept a level head because of her baby.</p><p>It was also the biggest reason she chose to stay with Kevin. She <a href=#>said</a>: “I think that’s the only thing that really got me through. I wasn’t ready at the time to just give up on my family. I wanted Kenzo to be able to know his dad and grow up.”</p><p>The rumors began in July 2017, but <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a> initially denied them. He continued to do so until some months later when he came forward to publicly apologize to his wife and his two kids with Torrei Hart after someone attempted to extort him.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02ainqaqpHqsrdKhZKGZoql6rLHVoqVmoJGnwbR5xaKprKxdmLWquMNmrqKsmGKyr7XKqGSpmaKntrS0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
