Despite three wide releases, the overall box office dropped to $52.1 million, making this the worst weekend since January and the first weekend since May 2021 where no film grossed over $10 million. The newcomers failed to spark and the top film from last weekend took a massive plunge in the final weekend of August, and while the month outperformed August 2021 (which had a $418 million cume compared to this month’s $451 million with still a few days to go), September may bring us to box-office lows we haven’t seen since the late May 2021 summer kickoff.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Read more at Box Office Mojo</a></p><p><strong>The Flash star Ezra Miller has found themselves under a lot of heat recently, leaving many fans wondering if the performer’s solo superhero flick would ever hit the big screen.

A combination of creative freedom, a large budget, strong visual effects, and good timing went into making the lavish fantasy series such a success, and the series has topped streaming charts across the globe. But of course, the path to&nbsp;<strong>The Sandman</strong>&nbsp;is littered with attempted adaptations that never quite hit the mark. In a&nbsp;new interview with&nbsp;Rolling Stone, Gaiman reflected on the long journey&nbsp;<strong>The Sandman</strong>&nbsp;has taken to the screen.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Read more at The Mary Sue</a></p><p><strong>The movies of the 1980s were filled with wacky side characters, and here are some of the best that deserve their own spin-off stories.</strong></p><p>“Movies are&nbsp;made by the quality&nbsp;of their supporting characters. Oh sure, the leads are the people that drive the story, but if they don’t have&nbsp;quirky best friends to bounce off, what’s the point?

However, the main reason&nbsp;PC gamers were so excited about it—apart from the fact it remains very good!—was because it would let them mod a PlayStation game to hell and back.
