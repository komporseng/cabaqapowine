When I’m with my son, I don’t have time to showcase it because he is a lot to deal with!”&nbsp;</p><p>And while Jayda and Lil Baby are no longer together, she has spoken about being on friendly terms with the artist and co-parents their son without any big issues.</p><p>At the time of writing, Jayda Cheaves is probably single.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Mike Rosenthal Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Jayda Cheaves – Net Worth</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-46394 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jayda-Cheaves-Net-Worth-3.jpg.webp alt="Jayda Cheaves Net Worth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -
