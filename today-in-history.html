Holliday is known for his close friendship with U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp, whom he assisted during the infamous <a href=# rel=noopener>shootout at the O.K. Corral</a> between in the Arizona city of Tombstone in 1881.</p><p>Previously, Holliday had worked as a dentist in Georgia before he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved out West in hopes that the drier climate would help his symptoms.

The 515-foot building is the tallest twin-spired church in the world as well as the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe.</p><p>Construction originally began in 1248, and work proceeded intermittently until the 16th century, when it stopped altogether. A large medieval crane marked the Cologne skyline for 400 years as the building sat unfinished. But in the 1800s, the original plan for the church’s façade was discovered, and construction finally resumed in 1842.</p><h2>1900: The Boxer Rebellion Is Crushed</h2><p>European, American, and Japanese forces seize Beijing to crush the Boxer Rebellion. The Boxer Rebellion was an anti-foreigner rebellion fought by the “boxers,” or Chinese villagers, many of whom had martial arts experience. At the time, Western missionaries were prevalent in China, spreading Christianity. China had lost the Sino-Japanese War five years earlier, and ordinary Chinese people worried that foreign interference would eventually take over the Qing government.</p><p>The Boxers started their rebellion by attacking missionaries across the country. The Chinese government’s inability to control the Boxers led to direct foreign military intervention. In total, up to 300,000 Boxers fought against up to 225,000 European, American, and Japanese forces. The conflict ended in the Boxer’s defeat and led to the severe weakening of the Chinese government.</p><h2>1945: World War II Comes To An End</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-380027 alt="V-J Day Kiss" width=600 height=913 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/v-j-day-kiss.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-380027 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>The iconic “V-J Day in Times Square” photo captured by Alfred Eisenstaedt.</span></p><p>Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan announces its unconditional surrender to the Allies.
