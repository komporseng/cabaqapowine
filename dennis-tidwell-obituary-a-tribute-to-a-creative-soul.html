This morning, Dennis suffered a huge heart attack while playing golf, and despite the determined and dogged attempts of his golfing pals to conduct CPR until medical services came, as well as the efforts of the medical professionals at Thomas hospital, he was unable to be revived. Dennis went away when he was doing what he loved most—golfing—other than spending time with his family.</p><p>He had just parred his final hole, and I have no doubt that as soon as he let go of the golf club, he took the hand of Jesus. This is my firm belief. Dennis was and still is cherished by many people. Our spirits have been crushed, and we can’t quite believe what just happened. Please pray for our family as we work through the difficult task of making funeral preparations and figuring out how to go on living without our cherished Dennis until he joins us in heaven. As we work out the details of the event, I will post about it on our company’s Facebook page, as well as on his page and my own.</p><p>I want to express how sorry I am that I have not been able to respond to any of the calls, texts, or messages that have been sent to me, as well as the great amount of love that has already been shown to us. I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by my wonderful relatives and friends that were in the area. The Tidwell Air Systems, LLC will carry on in a manner befitting its name and legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMSnpaKrXam2pcPEpaNmp5Kewbat0bJkmmWkp7ajwdOeZK2nXZZ6pL7EmquirpViwLDBy2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
