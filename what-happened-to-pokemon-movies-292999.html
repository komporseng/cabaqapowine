The coronavirus is inarguably what contributed the most to <i>Koko</i>'s poor performance (which still stands as the all-time franchise low point in box office numbers, if I recall correctly). The film was bumped from its traditional summer premiere date. The number of families interested in... you know, <i>not dying</i>, meant a lack of butts in theater seats. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and the annual <i>Pokémon</i> movies were far from the only casualty. I'd be curious to know whether or not the film's home video sales made up for this in any meaningful way.<p>But while COVID's an easy thing to blame, we can't forget that the <i>Pokémon</i> movies weren't exactly enjoying a massive wave of success even prior to the pandemic. <i>I Choose You</i> gave the franchise a much-needed shot in the arm at the box office and <i>Mewtwo Strikes Back EVOLUTION</i> did okay (although for a CG film I'm sure they were expecting more), but aside from that the film series was (and still is) in a pretty severe state of jeopardy. Box office returns had been getting progressively worse with every new movie during the <i>Best Wishes!</i> and <i>XY</i> eras, and even cultural phenomena like <i>Pokémon GO</i> didn't seem to conjure any meaningful boost in theaters.</p><p>"Well, it's the movies' fault for not being very good!", I hear you say. "They're just these silly little one-off stories that feel like extended episodes!" And you'd have a point, except... that's exactly what series like <i>Doraemon</i> and <i>Detective Conan</i> do and their yearly films continue to enjoy HUGE success theatrically (with the latter continually breaking box office records). This is a problem very specific to this franchise. Ignoring the pandemic, the annual <i>Pokémon</i> summer blockbuster is no longer the must-see movie event for Japanese audiences that it used to be, and the production staff is clearly having a very difficult and stressful time identifying why that is.</p><p>I suspect they'll try again in 2023, no doubt leaning on the franchise's extended absence from theaters as a marketing ploy. ("We're finally back!") What form that movie will take (and whether they even try to sustain annual installments after this) is anyone's guess. The <i>Sun & Moon</i> era has proven that the movies don't need to be based on a currently-airing TV series to be successful. It's a blank canvas; they can be anything. That's great for creativity, but horribly stressful when trying to figure out what audiences want. There are many pillars of success that keep <i>Pokémon</i> afloat, but I think it's become increasingly obvious by this point that the yearly film series isn't one of 'em.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaCkuKa5zqdkpqemnrK0epFyaXJxaWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
