Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>He was in the United States Air Force before he began his YouTube career. He later served in the United States Air Force and was posted in Japan. After leaving the military, he returned to the US. He was the first among his brothers to set up a channel on YouTube on April 30, 2013. The first video, titled ‘Star’s “As The World Turns” (Season 1 – Japan Edition) (Ep. 1)’, went online on 3 June. His most viewed video is “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Try Not To Laugh Challenge Reaction!</a>”</p><p>He made content on a variety of topics, but the majority of them were reaction videos. In time, he became a full-time reactor and was the first person on the website to be so. At the height of his popularity, he was getting millions of views on each upload.&nbsp;On June 4, 2015, he set up his second channel for vlogging and movie reviews, naming it Jinx Reloaded.</p><p>He has a third channel, Skye Crew, which he has set up for himself and his daughter. The heavy criticism concerning his reaction videos affected him deeply. In the end, he decided not to make any more reaction videos but focused on uploading movie reviews and Snapchat vlogs. He moved all of his content from Jinx Reloaded to his main channel.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77121 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Jinx-video.jpg alt=Jinx width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77121 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: He is in one of his YouTube videos. Source: YouTube</p><h4>More</h4><p>On August 7 and 8, 2015, he put out his Extended Play ‘The Rap of All Trades’ on SoundCloud and iTunes. Initially, it didn’t receive much attention. Following the reaction controversy, he thought it would be a good idea to make music videos of some of the songs from the EP. But it ended up attracting a fresh wave of criticism.</p><p>In recent months, his content has considerably improved. He has been releasing comedy skits and unboxing videos. He has also been active as a hip-hop artist and recently put out three new tracks, ‘Never Say Never, ‘I Want’, and ‘My Crew’.</p><h4>Controversies & Scandals</h4><p>Following the success of him and his brother as reactors, a lot of other channels decided to emulate them. By late 2015, there were thousands of reaction channels on YouTube. Soon the original creators of the site began to notice the trend. The response was immediate. There was universal condemnation.</p><p>Some of the top YouTube stars, including Pewdiepie, Doctor Ian Mantis Toboggan, I Hate Everything, DramaAlert, GradeAUnderA, LeafyIsHere, and JacksFilms, spoke out, criticizing him and his ilk. They felt that they were not adding any creative value to the video when they were reacting to them. Facing such widespread criticism, he tried to defend himself in a video titled ‘Message to YouTubers, but it ended up only aggravating the situation.</p><p>Eventually, he announced that he was quitting doing reaction videos for good. After he released the music videos of three tracks from his EP ‘The Rap of All Trades, he was accused of illegal sampling after using the copyrighted material of another person in his music without giving the original creator due credit.</p><p>All the songs were taken down either by DMCA or him. Universal, which represented some of the original artists, launched a formal DMCA complaint against him, and the tracks were subsequently removed from SoundCloud as well.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Reflecting on his personal life, he is dating <strong>Mercedes Stanley</strong>. She is also a social media personality, who has a channel on YouTube named ‘MzBenz TV’. On September 14, 2017, they welcomed their daughter Skye Milan Mercedes Brady. The small and happy family is living a healthy and prosperous life. Moreover, he currently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77119 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Jinx-kid.jpg alt=Jinx width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77119 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jinx and his daughter clicking a photo.
