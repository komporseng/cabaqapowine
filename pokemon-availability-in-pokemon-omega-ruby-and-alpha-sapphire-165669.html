And some people like me don't like duplicate Pokémon. So giving the Beldum a Metagrossite and having it obtainable just after you help Steven fight Team Magma is good for people who don't catch duplicates. The only reason I would catch a Pokémon with a complete entry in my Pokédex is for if I need a branch evolution or if I traded it to an in-game trainer.<p>Anyway, to take advantage of Latias and Latios being in the Hoenn Pokédex, let's unlock their roaming by solving the weather crisis in Sootopolis City. Steven take you to the nearest house for you to listen to a news story about a red/blue bird flying around Hoenn. However, after the Elite Four, you'll still watch a news story about a legendary roaming Hoenn. One of the three Musketeers would roam depending on your game. In OmegaRuby, Terrakion will roam. In AlphaSapphire, Virizion will run around. After getting both Pokémon registered in your Pokédex, a news story about Cobalion will be broadcast and you can hunt him in Hoenn. The Musketeers won't go in the water. When you caught all the Musketeers and have a Musket Ticket, you can go to Musketeer Island.</p><p>I decided to change the legendary dogs locations. Suicune still roams the Sevii Islands after you connect the Network Machine to Kalos. Raikou now roams Hoenn after you catch Zapdos. Entei will appear at Mt. Chimney after you catch Suicune and Raikou.</p><p>Zapdos is in a new basement in New Mauville, where Magneton and Nosepass can evolve. Articuno is in the last room in Icefall Cave. Moltres is on the Summet of Mt. Ember</p><p>Where to put Dialga and Palkia? An alternate dimension with a portal in Cave of Origin. Dialga is in AlphaSapphire while Palkia is an OmegaRuby exclusive. After catching them, you will have access to the Distortion World, which now has a lot of wild encounters of strong ghost types like Mismagius. There, you will find Giratina in his Origin Forme.</p><p>Ho-Oh and Lugia can be found on Naval Rock. This time, you don't need an event ticket to get to them. You just need a legendary trio. Bring Articuno, Moltres and Zapdos to the bottom and encounter Lugia. Go to the top with Entei, Suicune and Raikou to catch Ho-Oh. And these legendaries you bring must be the ones you caught in the same adventure. No outsiders would unlock Ho-Oh or Lugia.</p><p>Regigigas can be found in the basement of the Monean Chamber in the Tanoby Ruins. He'll only wake up if you have the three Regis. None of them can be outsiders. Must be the ones caught in-game. Regirock is in Desert Ruins, Regice is in an Island Cave and Registeel is in Ancient Tomb, all opened by a braille puzzle in the Sealed Chamber under Route 134.</p><p>Cresselia and Darkrai can be found in Newmoon and Fullmoon islands. Yep, those are the same islands from Sinnoh. An NPC on the islands tell you that. However, when you check the PokéNav, the map will be zoomed in on the island. And when you try to walk to Sinnoh with the walk-through-walls cheat, you go through glitchy space until you end up in a random part of Hoenn. This is all you'll ever see of Sinnoh in the game. But this requires the Lunar Wing or Membership Pass to get to.</p><p>Where to put Reshiram and Zekrom? A hidden chamber in Meteor Falls. Reshiram is in OmegaRuby. Zekrom in AlphaSapphire. After you catch one, Kyurem will come a day later.</p><p>Groudon and Kyogre are obviously caught in Cave of Origin depending on the game. Rayquaza is still at the top of Sky Pillar.</p><p>Jirachi is on Star Island, which requires a Wish Ticket. Deoxys is on Birth Island when you have an Aurora Ticket. When you get an Old Sea Map, you catch Mew on Faraway Island.</p><p>Uxie, Mesprit and Azelf will roam the Sevii Islands after you connect the Network Machine to Unova. Which one will roam? Depend on your Hoenn starter. If you picked Treecko, you'll run into Uxie. Had Torchic? Catch Azelf. Mudkip lovers can hunt Mesprit.</p><p>Tornadus and Thundarus will roam all of Hoenn and Sevii. Yep, sometimes they go to Hoenn and sometimes they are in the Sevii Islands. Tornadus is in OmegaRuby while Thundarus is exclusive to AlphaSapphire. They roam after you catch the other roaming legendaries in the game. That means you have to catch the Eon bird, Suicune, Raikou, a Musketeer (Cobalion don't count), and a Lake Guardian. Landorus roams Hoenn and Sevii after you catch all the roaming legendaries of both games including Cobalion, Tornadus and Thundarus and bring them to one game.</p><p>Manaphy can be found on Sea Island when you have a Water Ticket. Phione can be obtained by breeding Manaphy.</p><p>Get a Woodland Ticket to go to Forest Island and catch Celebi.</p><p>Shaymin is found on Paradise Island (not to be confused with Themyscira). A Flower Ticket is needed.</p><p>Arceus is found on Genesis Island if you have an Azure Ticket.</p><p>Victini is on Victory Island if you have a Champion Ticket.</p><p>Meloetta is on Music Island if you have a Musical Ticket.</p><p>Genesect is on Cyborg Island if you have a Cyber Ticket.</p><p>You get a choice of Johto Starters along with the National Pokédex from Professor Birch. You're rewarded a Sinnoh starter from Cynthia when you get one Silver Symbol. You choose your Unova starter when you use the X and Y hieroglyphs to connect Celio's Network Machine to Kalos. And of course, you rescue Birch with your Hoenn starter.</p><p>Lanette can give you an Eevee as an award for filling up a box after getting the National Pokédex.</p><p>Now what else am I missing? Rattata swarms Route 102. Meowth is a common AlphaSapphire exclusive in the Sevii Islands. Misdreavus is in Lost Cave. You can find the Unown in the Tanoby Chambers. Stantler's in the Safari Zone. Kricketot is in Pattern Bush. Cherubi swarms Route 117. Buneary swarms Route 104 in AlphaSapphire. Glameow swarms Route 101 in AlphaSapphire. Finneon is all you can catch with an Old Rod in the Sevii Islands. Cottonee is common in the Sevii Islands in OmegaRuby. Darumaka can be found in Kindle Road and Mt. Ember. Yamask can be found in Lost Cave. Frillish is common when surfing in the Sevii Islands. Tynamo can be found in the new basement of New Mauville. Elgyem can be found in the Friend Safari of Four Island. Bouffallant can be found in Ruin Valley. The Hoenn Dex Pokémon not found in Kalos can be found in their Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald locations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXZbDorXLmpmipJmpxm61zWanqKOVoryvec6mnKCZXafCo8WMmqWdZZGhvamtjKyYqaiYnr%2BmepBvbG9uaWS9orPEZmo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
