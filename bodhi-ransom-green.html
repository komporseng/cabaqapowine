However, because of the age gap, Austin Green was initially hesitant to start a relationship, as he was 30, and she was just 18.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/5/24/e55319ffee52b5aa11ba95caa50ddaaf-1590324351299.jpg><p>But the lovebirds began dating after a few talks and dates and declared their engagement in November 2006. And their relationship ended in February 2009, but somehow they re-engaged on June 1, 2010.</p><p>On June 24, 2010, Fox and her partner were married in an intimate, sunset ceremony on Hawaii beach.
