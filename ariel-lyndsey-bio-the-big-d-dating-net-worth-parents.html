Then, Ariel started working as a social media influencer and eventually decided to move to Los Angeles to exponentiate her career and expand her horizons. This created a distance between them and with Ariel keeping her work as her number one priority, Blair sought comfort elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Obviously, though Ariel admits that her career’s responsible for their distance, infidelity was just unforgivable. Thus, she divorced him without a second thought after four years of marriage in October 2020.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, later, as things cool down, Ariel wanted to patch things up, and in hopes of rekindling their love, she signed them for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Big D</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Ariel and Blair for the inaugural season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Big D</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were their co-stars — Gillian Messina and David Novello, Ally Lee and David Mims, Thakur Wint, and Dede Lewis, <a href=#>Alexis Nicole</a> and Devon Wright, and Brooks Peters and <a href=#>Casey Costa</a>.</span></p><h3><b>Is Ariel Lyndsey Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ariel Lyndsey kept her dating life out of light after filming </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Big D</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
