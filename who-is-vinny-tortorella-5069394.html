But three weeks later, during the April 27 episode, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he proposed</a> while the cast was on a trip to New Orleans! Prior to Vinny’s introduction on the show, Angelina talked about “Vinny 2.0” quite a few times, but it wasn’t until the April 20 episode that she introduced Vinny to everyone, and it was at the end of that episode that he told producers he was planning to propose to Angelina. The decision came as quite a shock to viewers, as Angelina had just recently said that she wasn’t putting a label on her relationship with Vinny. But he ended up proposing, and she said, “Yes!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“This is something I need at this point in my life,” Angelina admitted on the show before Vinny proposed. “I didn’t feel loved in my last relationship. I would literally wear lingerie walking around the house half-naked and he wouldn’t even look at me. Going into a relationship where the guy likes to be intimate, tells you how beautiful you are…I mean, Vin can’t get his hands off me. It’s a different world and it feels so good to be loved.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/JS-Angelina-Engaged-Vinny-T-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Angelina was previously married to&nbsp;<strong>Chris Larangeira</strong>, who she wed in Nov. 2019. However, the marriage was short-lived. The pair’s ups and downs played out on&nbsp;Jersey Shore throughout their relationship, and by the beginning of 2021, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>things were rocky</a>. Angelina even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> at the time, although it was eventually called off. Although the two <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tried to reconcile</a> throughout the summer of 2021, Chris filed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>for divorce</a> at the beginning of 2022, and it was finalized in July.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Meanwhile, Angelina filmed&nbsp;All Star Shore at the end of 2021 amidst her troubles with Chris. While on the show, she met&nbsp;<strong>Luis ‘Potro’ Caballero</strong>. Although Angelina insisted that the two did not hook up during filming, they continued to explore their relationship afterward, but the fling eventually fizzled out. On the current season of Jersey Shore, Angelina has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been seen flirting</a> with&nbsp;co-star,&nbsp;<strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong>, and even admitted to having “real feelings” for him before things got more serious with Vinny 2.0. Learn more about her new relationship below:</p><h2>How Old Is Vinny Tortorella?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>When Angelina first started talking to Vinny, she told her&nbsp;Jersey Shore cast mates that he was 19 years old. However, during a Jan. 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TooFab</a>, she clarified the model is actually in his 30s, although she did not reveal her man’s exact age. “People think he’s a 19 year old that lives in my garage and I’m like…what!?” Angelina laughed. “Where did that come from? Did you see that episode where I said he was 19? He’s not 19. He’s in his 30s.”&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a> reports that Vinny is 34 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/angelina-pivarnicks-new-boyfriend-mtv-embed.jpg><h2>Where Is Vinny Tortorella From?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Like Angelina, Vinny comes from Staten Island. The irony has not been lost on Angelina and her castmates that she is now dating another Vinny from Staten Island, just like Vinny Guadagnino, who she’s hooked up with in the past. “There’s so many other names in the world and you’re dating Vinny from Staten Island,”&nbsp;<strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong> pointed out on an episode of&nbsp;Jersey Shore.</p><h2>Angelina & Vinny Live Together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The cast trip to New Orleans took place in November 2022, so they had already been seeing each other in some capacity for several weeks at that point. “We’re getting a little bit more serious,” Angelina said on the March 16 episode of Jersey Shore, which was filmed weeks before the NOLA trip. “Things have been heating up between us and we’re definitely moving along in our relationship. I mean, he’s already got a toothbrush in my house on his side, so I even say it’s his side. Think about that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Angelina was packing for New Orleans, she shared an update on the romance and revealed that she was now living with Vinny. “Things have been heating up between me and Vinny and he moved in with me,” she dished. “I don’t know what the future holds, but I’m definitely here for it.” The exact timeline of their relationship is unclear, but Angelina revealed that they met after following each other on Instagram. They appear to have started seeing each other at the beginning of 2022, shortly after Angelina’s split from Chris.</p><h2>What Does Vinny Tortorella Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Vinny is a model, although there is very little about his career online. He attended Wagner College in New York and has his Master’s Degree in accounting, according to&nbsp;The Sun. It does not seem that Vinny has any public social media profiles either.</p><h2>Did Vinny Propose To Angelina?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>In 2022, a video surfaced online of the&nbsp;Jersey Shore cast in New Orleans, and it appeared to show Vinny getting down on one knee and proposing to Angelina during a cast dinner. This trip aired on the show in April 2023, confirming that he did, in fact, propose to her. His proposal aired during the April 27 episode.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Angelina has also opened up about wanting kids with Vinny, despite only being together for a few months. “I had a conversation with him about freezing my eggs and he doesn’t want that for me,” Angelina admitted.”He’s like,’Why would you freeze your eggs when we can just have kids?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LDqrrNsmStp6KpvLOxy6WYZm1ga4Z0hZNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
