FX certainly has no shortage of gripping drama titles in its catalog, both with classic shows like <strong>The Shield</strong> and <strong>Sons of Anarchy</strong> as well as more recent hits like <strong>The Americans</strong> and <strong>Snowfall</strong>. All these beloved shows and more have earned FX more acclaim and Emmy nominations to last a lifetime, but one show, in particular, has stood the test of time as an all-time great television program. That series is <a href=#><strong>Justified</strong></a>, a brilliant modern-day take on the Western formula that sees a U.S. Marshal based in Miami, Florida go back to his home state Kentucky, so he can navigate a complicated web of crime and murder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that the series is six seasons long is a testament to just how popular the show is, and while the epic series finale is fondly remembered as one of the strongest episodes, fans of the series have long desired to see Raylan Givens get back in the saddle for more daring escapades. Well, FX has answered those prayers with Justified: City Primeval, a sequel series to Justified that sees Marshal Givens travel to Detroit to take down a whole new kind of criminal. The series still draws from the source material of author <strong>Elmore Leonard</strong>'s novels, with the new series taking explicit inspiration from City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit. To learn more about the sequel show's release date, cast, trailer, and more, here is our helpful guide to Justified: City Primeval.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Editor's Note: This article was last updated on September 24.</p><h2 id=when-and-where-did-39-justified-city-primeval-39-release>When and Where Did 'Justified: City Primeval' Release?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/justified-timothy-olyphant.jpg><p>Justified: City Primeval premiered on FX on July 18, 2023.

The three-time Emmy nominee played the beloved protagonist for all six seasons of Justified and is considered by fans of the books as a perfect choice for the complex lawman, so it's great that he'll be returning for Justified: City Primeval. Though his time with the show ended in 2015, Olyphant would put his skills as a western hero to good use in the <strong>Star Wars</strong> universe when <a href=#>he played Marshal Cobb Vanth in <strong>The Mandalorian</strong></a> and <strong>The Book of Boba Fett</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Acting opposite Olyphant in the antagonist role is <a href=#><strong>Boyd Holbrook</strong></a>, who will be playing the notorious "Oklahoma Wildman" Clement Mansell, who goes toe to toe with the Marshal. Holbrook also has plenty of experience playing villains in pseudo-westerns, such as when he played the leader of the mutant-hunting Reavers in <strong>Logan</strong>. The rest of the cast is rounded out by <strong>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor</strong> (King Richard), <strong>Alexander Pobutsky</strong> (The Blacklist), <strong>Yosef Kasnetzkov</strong> (FBI), <strong>Estavion White</strong> (The Coleman Show), <strong>Marin Ireland</strong> (Hell or High Water), <strong>Adelaide Clemens</strong> (The Great Gatsby), <strong>Amin Joseph</strong> (Snowfall), and <strong>Vondie Curtis-Hall</strong> (Daredevil).</p><h2 id=who-is-making-justified-city-primeval>Who Is Making Justified: City Primeval?</h2><p>Many crew members of the original Justified will be returning to bring their talents to the table, including two of the directors, <strong>Jon Avnet</strong> (Fried Green Tomatoes) and <strong>Michael Dinner</strong> (Mayans M.C.). Dinner will also be a part of the impressive writers' room for the show, which also includes <strong>Dave Andron</strong> (Snowfall), <strong>VJ Boyd</strong> (S.W.A.T.), <strong>Eisa Davis</strong> (She's Gotta Have It), <strong>Taylor Elmore</strong> (Limitless), <strong>Chris Provenzano </strong>(Guilty Party), and <strong>Cole Quirk</strong> (Edge of Internment). Timothy Olyphant will also be producing the series in addition to starring. Dave Andron and Michael Dinner are the showrunners of Justified: City Primeval. Fun fact: the idea for the series revival reportedly came about after <a href=#>a conversation that Olyphant had with <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong></a>. At one point, Tarantino was expected to direct an episode of the new series but has since dropped out of the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other major crew members include cinematographer <strong>Jeffrey Greeley</strong> (Castle Rock), editors <strong>Hunter M. Via</strong> (The Mist) and <strong>Marta Evry</strong> (Lovecraft Country), and production designer <strong>Marke Dobrowolski</strong> (The Walking Dead).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kt7a%2F06Kdop2UYrCqwNhmp6uhnZrDoriMramaoZyav26%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmnaKqo6l6rbvOpGScmaOpeqS%2BxJqrqKqjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
