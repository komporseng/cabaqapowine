One of the seven couples to grace the show is Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo. Like many couples, the pair met each other online and got close with each other over time.

I love you.” So you know, they reportedly met each other in March 2020.</p><p>But the pair has a major age gap and fans of the show don’t see how the couple are compatible with each other that their relationship would flourish.</p><p>Gino Surely has taste for international women. He was single coming out of seven years of marriage with his Russian wife that ended in a painful divorce. He seems to be in love with Jasmine. However, he accused Jasmine of having a jealous nature that could probably derail the relationship between the two. But, his ultimate goal with Jasmine is to propose Jasmine. Moreover, he is reportedly desperate to start a family with his girlfriend Jasmine.</p><p>Gino’s ex-wife is out of the picture because he scrubbed her off his social media.

Gino and Jasmine have been interacting with each other since August 2020.</p><p>However, Jasmine might be hiding a secret of her own, at least from us fans of the show. Like Gino, she is also previously married. Back in the post from 28 May 2018, she mentioned on her <a href=#>post</a> that she has a husband.</p><p>So, the question remains are they still together? Because Jasmine hasn’t posted anything about Gino for a long time. However, there are tell-tell signs that they might be together and their relationship did work properly. In August 2021, Gino’s uncle Marco commented on <a href=#>her post</a>. So, they might be still together because Gino’s family who are important to him, is still in touch with Jasmine.</p><h3><strong>Jasmine Pineda Height</strong></h3><p>Speaking of height, Jasmine Pineda stands tall to the height of around 5 feet 8 inches.
