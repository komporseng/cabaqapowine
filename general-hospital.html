General Hospital had viewers on the edge of their seats during the March 14 episode as Jason explained to Michael where he’d been since his latest “death.” And his story made sense: We could totally buy John and the feds strong-arming Stone Cold into becoming a weapon against the forces of darkness."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The feds have no shortage of marksmen, they don’t need Jason to be their assassin. What they might find harder to come by is an individual with Mob ties as deep as Jason’s, someone that a Big Bad would delight in using against his or her enemies.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/JPI_ghEpisode12262_604223.jpg alt='Steve Burton "General Hospital" Set The Prospect Studios ABC Studios Los Angeles 02/14/11 ©Howard Wise/jpistudios.com 310-657-9661 Episode # 12262 U.S.Airdate 03/15/11' width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>So yes, at the end of the day, Jason is working, however reluctantly, for the feds. But to accomplish the mission that’s been set forth for him, we wager that he’s had to infiltrate the underworld empire of…&nbsp;Cyrus Renault. How can we be sure?</p><p>First, let’s look at Jason’s actions since his resurrection. Apparently, he helped take out bonkers Mafia queenpin Olivia Jerome. And he had to have been a part of the (deliberately) botched hit on Sonny and Ava. Who would want them pushing up daisies? Besides the few folks who haven’t drunk the “But some mobsters are good mobsters” Kool Aid.</p><p>Cyrus. If he were to remove from the chess board <a href=# rel=noopener>all of Port Charles’ other career criminals</a>, it would be “game over,” and he’d have won. There wouldn’t even be any rival mafiosos around to scoff at his “I’ve changed” mantra.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cyrus-nina-soul-saver-gh-abc.jpg alt="Cyrus preaches to Nina GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Second, let’s look at Jason’s new ink. In Steve Burton’s years away from General Hospital, he got a massive religious tattoo on his arm. It would be pretty clever of the soap to work it into the story rather than cover it up by eventually revealing that Jason got it to prove his allegiance to “pious” Cyrus.</p><p>You can take a closer look at the intricacy of the artwork below.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gh-jason-tattoo-1.png alt="jason tattoo" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What do you think?
