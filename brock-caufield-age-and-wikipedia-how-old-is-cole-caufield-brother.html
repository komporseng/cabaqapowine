Brock has a long way to go before he joins his younger brother in the NHL.&nbsp;</p><p>In a short time, his brother, Cole Caufield, has become a star player for the Canadiens. During the pre-season game against the Ottawa Senators, Caufield scored the game-winning goal and added an assist.&nbsp;</p><p>The older brother, Brock Caufield, is the most loyal supporter of his brother despite the comparison. He is proud that he and his brother are continuing the family legacy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Brock Caufield Age And Wikipedia</h2><p>Born on March 9, 1999, Brock Caufield is two years older than his brother, Cole Caufield. Like his brother, Brock was coached by their father, Paul Caufield.</p><p>The two brothers spent endless hours training in Stevens Point, where their father ran the local rink. Brock began playing for Stevens Points Area High in 2013 and played 24 games in his first season.&nbsp;</p><p>A right winger, Brock Caufield scored 11 goals and made 13 assists. After playing three seasons with Stevens Points and making 69 appearances, Brocked joined Green Bay Gamblers.&nbsp;</p><p>But after playing one game, he joined Team Wisconsin 16U AAA, making 36 appearances in one season, before rejoining Gamblers the next season. He played two seasons with Green Bay Gamblers, making 117 appearances, and earned 57 points for the team.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/brock-caufield-age.jpg><p>Bidding goodbye to USHL, Brock joined the University of Wisconsin, where he continued his hockey career. He played five seasons with the Badgers, joining the team in 2018.</p><p>In his <a href=# rel=noopener>freshman season</a>, Brocked played all 37 games, scored seven goals, and earned 12 points. In his junior year, Brock earned the honors of Big Ten Sportsmanship and Dr. Joseph Coyne – Joe Pavelski Most Consistent award. He scored ten goals and made a career-high 17 points.&nbsp;</p><p>Heading into his senior season in 2021, Brock was named the Alternate Captain. He once again earned the honors of Academic All-Big Ten and won back-to-back Dr. Joseph Coyne/Joe Pavelski Most Consistent Award.&nbsp;</p><p>In his fifth year, Brock played 36 games and broke his career-high record, winning 23 points for the team. Earlier this year, Brock signed with the AHL team Toronto Marlies, affiliated to the NHL team Toronto Maple Leafs.&nbsp;</p><p>After going undrafted, Brock certainly has received a second chance to prove himself on the ice. And if he does succeed, we could soon see two Caufileds in the NHL spotlight.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Caufield Brothers Come From A Sporty Family</h2><p>The two Caufield brothers have a long history with the sport. It started with their grandfather, Wayne Caufield.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne played semi-pro hockey at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, before finishing his career with Milwaukee Admirals. He began to coach hockey to the youths of the Milwaukee area and was later inducted into the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame.</p><p>Their father, Paul Caufield, played for the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and became the school’s all-time leading scorer. He played 148 games, scoring 126 goals and making 128 assists.&nbsp;</p><p>Their mother, Kelly Caufield, a teacher, didn’t understand the sport but supported her two sons’ dreams. In 2019, when Cole was selected to play in the U18 World Championship in Sweden, the couple couldn’t afford the trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cole-caufield-parents.jpg><p>They also couldn’t attend their son’s debut game in April 2021 as the borders were closed. The first live game the couple watched was in June 2021, as the Canadiens took on Vegas in Game 1 of the third round of the NHL playoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>Their trip proved fruitful as they saw their son score a goal, and their reaction went viral over the internet. The couple gave high fives to the ones close to them and shared a sweet hug as they cheered on their son.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Caufield has become the Canadiens’ main man and has earned himself a $62.8 million contract. Now, Paul and Kelly will be hoping they can attend an NHL game for their older son one day.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCu0aiapGWTlsKntcSlm2aZl5p6orrDZq6io5mlsqW1wGafqK9dpLmlecisZJynnJp6pK3Un6CepJRir7O706Gcq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
