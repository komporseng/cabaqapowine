Rashta loses her luster the moment she catches sight of it. She was curious as to the circumstances behind the infant’s arrival. Since the infant has never been held by its mother since birth, the visitors have asked the empress to give the infant a hug and bless it.</p><p>Rashta is aware that if she declines, it will make people uncomfortable. She remembered it being quite rigid and frigid when she held it in the past. However, suddenly it seemed quite active and alive.
