Until their friendship appeared to collapse in 2016, they flaunted their intimacy on red carpets and social media. Karlie Kloss was recently spotted at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, reigniting speculation about what transpired between the two celebrities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Taylor-Swift-and-Karlie-Kloss-relationship-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_between_Taylor_Swift_and_Karlie_Kloss></span><strong>What happened between Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss? </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Karlie Kloss was seen at Taylor Swift’s concert in Los Angeles on Wednesday, suggesting that the two may have revived their connection.</p><p>Gigi Hadid, Selena Gomez, Cara Delevingne, Lorde, and Blake Lively were among the “Girl Squad” of A-list celebrities who were Swift and Kloss’ close friends for years before their connection appeared to break in 2019. Swift would be joined by The Girl Squad on red carpets, at award ceremonies, and even onstage on her record-breaking tours.</p><p>Even though Kloss was unable to take the stage in Los Angeles this week, her appearance in the audience at Swift’s concert at the SoFi Stadium as part of her record-breaking The Eras Tour sent social media ablaze.</p><p>Social media users saw pictures and videos of the model taking selfies with fans while donning a cream vest and wide-leg trousers. One individual posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, “Karlie Kloss taking pics with fans at The Eras Tour tonight!” In 2013, the two people established a close friendship and even posed on the cover of Vogue magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/karlie-kloss-taylor-swift-1024x576.jpg><p>For years, they were inseparable, but in 2016, admirers noticed they seemed to be spending less time together. As soon as they saw the music video for Taylor Swift’s 2017 song “Look What You Made Me Do,” they became certain they were breaking up. The singer wore a t-shirt with the names of her other well-known acquaintances, but Kloss’ name was absent.</p><p>However, in 2018, Kloss dispelled rumors of a disagreement by telling The New York Times that they still frequently chatted and cautioned readers not to accept everything they read. In the same year, she made an appearance backstage at one of Swift’s concerts and shared a selfie with her on Instagram.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Model_Was_Seen_During_a_Concert></span><strong>A Model Was Seen During a Concert</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans were still skeptical, particularly after Swift skipped both of Kloss’ weddings to Josh Kushner, the brother of Kloss’ new husband and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump.</p><p>After that, Swift sparked even more fan discussion when some people believed that the extra tracks “It’s Time to Go” and “Right Where You Left Me” from her 2020 album, Evermore, seemed to allude to the breakup.</p><p>In the song “It’s Time to Go,” there are lines like, “When the words of a sister, come back in whispers, that prove she was not, in fact, what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams, she’s a crook who was caught.”</p><p>Some have even suggested that Kloss’ continuous professional connection with Scooter Braun, a music executive and talent manager, was the reason why the two fell out. Even after the start of his continuing dispute with Swift, Braun continues to manage Kloss.</p><p>Braun, who founded Scooter Braun Projects in 2007 and later acquired Swift’s label Big Machine Label Group for $300 million in 2019, also bought the masters of Swift’s entire discography.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Braun was charged with “incessant, manipulative bullying” over a period of years, according to the woman, who claimed she was unaware that Big Machine owner Scott Borchetta would sell the business to Braun. In 2020, Braun paid $300 million to an investment fund for the masters of her first six albums.</p><p>Swift claimed that when she signed a record deal as a youngster, the record company tricked her into giving up her master rights.</p><p>My worst-case scenario is this. This is what happens when you sign a contract at the age of fifteen with a person for whom “loyalty” is obviously merely a contractual idea. She later added on Tumblr, “And when that man says ‘Music has worth,’ he means that its value is owed to males who had no involvement in making it.</p><p>Swift, however, outsmarted Braun and the investment firm when she started redoing her older songs and re-releasing the CDs under the name “Taylor’s Version.”</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtorJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kYq6vsIykmKukmZp6rLjOrKpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
